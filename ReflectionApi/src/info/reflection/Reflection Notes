we have so many small API
like JdBc Api
servlet Api
jsp Api
jPa ApI
Reflection API
etc.
             and  the sunmicrosystem has classified into two API.They are 1. JSE API   2)JEE API
                1. under (JSE API)
                    jdbc Api 
                    reflection Api
                    jNDI Api
                2. under (JEE API)
                    servlet API
                    JSP API
                    JPA API
                    
                                   The Reflection API is part of JSE API
                    
          When we download java software we will not get API documentation.we need to download it seperately.
          
          
       The following of the most important classes of java.lang.reflect package are
                                  1.Field
                                  2.Constructor
                                  3.Method
                                  4.Parameter
    
    if we get the class object,we can get all the remaining objects available in the java.lang.reflect package.
    All IDE's internally use the Reflection API.when we type the contrl+1 we get all the available method in the class.
    because of this Reflection Api.
    Reflection means suppose  if u Put class opposite the mirror it reflects you same 
    image or(in that class what method and constructors availble it will shows) it  is the beauty of reflection API
    
    
    
    why we are learning about Reflection API ?
    Answer: to understanding of Annotations.
    We use Reflection API to process  Annotations
